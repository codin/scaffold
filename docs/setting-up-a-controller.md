#Setting up a controller

The logical side of your application will be controlled by the controllers that you create, with the default installation we provide you with a starting controller ```main``` which represents the index page of your application. In this section you will be shown how to produce an output from your controller and how to add another controller to your application and set it up in the routes.

First navigate to ```/app/controllers/main.php``` in this file you should see something along the lines of:

```php
class Main_controller extends Controller {
	public function __construct() {
		parent::__construct();

		//  Set template data
		$this->template->set(array(
			'hello' => 'world'
		));
	}
	
	public function index() {
		$this->template->render('main');
	}
}
```

Any controller within Scaffold must extend the ```Controller``` class, contain a constructor that constructs it's parent (```parent::__construct()```) and contains the default index method defined in ```/config/misc.php``` as mentioned in the previous section.

Taking a look at what is actually happening inside the constructor, we're using the template object to set some values which we can pass on to the view. In this example, we're setting a variable ```$hello``` to the value ```world```, as this is in the constructor this variable will be accessible in any view that belongs to this constructor via the routes.

Then in our default ```index``` method we call ```$this->template->render('main');``` which renders the main view located in ```/app/views/main.php```

Taking a look at our standard view we will find some html and the use of our ```hello``` variable.

```php
<p><?php echo $hello; ?></p>
<p>Hi there, and welcome to the wonderful world of <a href="http://scaffold.im">Scaffold</a>! What you&rsquo;re looking at (that's me) is the default controller.</p>
<p>You'll find me hanging around <code>app/controllers/main.php</code>, and the view (that's the fancy HTML outputting bit) is in <code>app/views/main.php</code>.</p>

<h2>New here?</h2>
<p>You'll probably want to read <a href="http://learn.scaffold.im">the documentation</a> through first. Although Scaffold's pretty easy to pick up, looking at a codebase can be pretty overwhelming the first time. You'll also want to know Scaffold's hidden tips and tricks as well, no doubt.</p>
```

This can be edited like any standard html page and should only contain the dynamic content for your application, any static content should be handled elsewhere and will be covered later on in the documentation.

We'll next create a new controller for example, so create a new file ```test.php``` in the directory ```/app/controllers/``` it should contain the following code:

```php
<?php defined('IN_APP') or die('Get out of here'); // Stops unwanted visits

public class Test extends Controller {

	public function __construct() {
		parent::__construct();

		$this->template->set(array(
			'test' => 'Hello this is the testing controller'
		));
	}

	public function index() {
		$this->template->render('test');
	}
}

?>
```

Once you've done this, save it and create a new file ```test.php``` within ```/app/views/``` this file should contain the following:

```php
<p><?php echo $test; ?></p>
```

This should output the value we have sent to the template in the constructor, and to follow the rest of the framework architecture we suggest you create a new model (note: this will be covered later), to do so create a new file ```test.php``` in ```/app/models/```, it should contain the following code:

```php
<?php defined('IN_APP') or die('Get out of here');

class Test_model extends Model {
	public function __construct() {
		parent::__construct();
	}
}
?>
```

Then to set up a route for the app navigate to the routes file, add the following (key, value) pair route to the array:

```'test' => 'test'```

You should now be able to see the out put if you navigate to ```/test``` in your app!

The next step in this documentation will detail how to properly set up a set of views.
