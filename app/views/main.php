<p>Hi there, and welcome to the wonderful world of <a href="http://scaffold.im">Scaffold</a>! What you&rsquo;re looking at (that's me) is the default controller.</p>
<p>You'll find me hanging around <code>app/controllers/main.php</code>, and the view (that's the fancy HTML outputting bit) is in <code>app/views/main.php</code>.</p>

<h2>New here?</h2>
<p>You'll probably want to read <a href="http://learn.scaffold.im">the documentation</a> through first. Although Scaffold's pretty easy to pick up, looking at a codebase can be pretty overwhelming the first time. You'll also want to know Scaffold's hidden tips and tricks as well, no doubt.</p>
